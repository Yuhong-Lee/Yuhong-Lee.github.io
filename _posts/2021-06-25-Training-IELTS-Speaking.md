1. Describe a famous person you are interested in 
2. Describe a singer (or actor) you like 

I think that should be Michal jackson who is the very famous singer around the world or even can be thought as one of the most famous singer in the world. He also named as king of the pop music. 

When the first time I heared his works, it is in the last year or my high school in which time I was under the pressure of the final exam we call it "Gao Kao" which is the examination for the entrance of collage. When I heard the song of him, beat it , you know, with a the music which is suffused with passion and energy which can directly relive the stress of mine

He went from rags to riches for his talent in the music However he was dead in 2009 with so much misunderstanding for paparazzi. To be honest, it is the time when i became a college student did I try to search him. Also for the research of him, I intrerest in his personality. He is a really good man who encourage all the human being should try to protect the environment in that famous song - earth song. He also focused on the human rights for his color. He built the castles for chilfren. Even at the end of the life he haven't get rid of the rumors and slanders. What a sad thing it is.

I like this man, i like his song and his personality

During my guradation project, we had meetings with a regular schedule. 
1. He is a strict teacher and extremly good at the study of his field. Therefore, he have a high requirement for my project which put me in a very stressful situation during the period of my final project. To be honest, I was nearly to be mad in that time because there were so many deadlines in a same time. All in all, all the things passed but a special memery.
