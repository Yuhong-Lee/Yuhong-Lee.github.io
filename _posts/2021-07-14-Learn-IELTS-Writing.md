It can be also benefit on the development of touriest industry. For example, in New Zealand, a country which is really nearly to the South Pole, one of the most important source of the income for it is the tourists who expect to explore the South Pole. Thanks for the remote travel, not only the transportation but also the industry of catering were all developed. 

For tourism, the benefit of polar tourism is to stimulate the economic development. A typical example is the New Zealand, a country which is really nearly to the South Pole. Becuase of the requirements of the remote movement for the tourists such as the airplane,steamship and long distance railway, its transportation industry developed well and made a huge economic benefits. And same for the industry of catering and hotel. When it comes to the scientists, they travel to remote areas for the studies. Every year, a large number of scientists, scholars or some students who are in the study field of geography, environment science, biology and so on will try to explore these areas for their studies and researches. The results of these researches promote the the development of society. For example, if Chinese Arctic expedition team did not find the melting glaciers, people in the would not realize the serious of the global warming.

However, the environmental pollution from the polar traveling cannot be ignored. There is a consensus that the ecological system in the polar area is extremely fragile. The dead bodies in these unimaginable cold area can be kept for a really long time which is same for the wastes. Therefore, the travel for these places can cause an eternal damage for the ecosystem in it. Fortunately, according to the convention of polar areas which is formulated by the United Nations, no one is allowed to leave any waste in polar areas. All of the wastes will be collected and take back to countries of touriests.
