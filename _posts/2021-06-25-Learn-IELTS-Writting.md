The bar diagram clearly illustrates the percentage of the people who buy or drink coffee and tea with different hobbies in five areas of Australia.

Obviously, with all more than 55%, going to cafe is the most popular way=choice for people to have a drinking of tea or coffee in Australia except Adelaide in where only 49% people went to a cafe for drink in last four weeks. Specially, in Sydney, Melbourne and Hoart, the percentage of consumers can be more than 60%. On the contrary, compared with other two methods, Australians do not like to buy the fresh coffee. In particular, less than 35% respondents bought the fresh coffee in Brisbane and Adelaide and even in Melbourne and Sydney where buying fresh coffee is more welcome than it in other three cities ( only near 44% people ).

Interestingly, in Adelaide, the instant coffee is the best choice(50%) for the people who expect to drink coffee or tea in last 4 weeks. It is noticeable that it is second rank in other four cities. And then slightly more than half people bought it in Brisbane and Hobart compared with them in Sydney and Melbourne where the value is less than 50 percent.

Adelaide is still distinctive as most people like to buy instant coffee with accurately 50%. Hobart is at the top with nearly 55%, next coming with B with 53%. The comsumption rate in rest two nations ranged between 45% and 50%.

As a conclusion, compared with other two ways, buying fresh coffee is not attractive enough for Australian consumers in these five cities despite more than half citizens drinking the coffee or tea in last 4 weeks.
