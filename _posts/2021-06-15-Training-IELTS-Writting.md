Obviously, ~~even reduced~~ despite a minor decline  from 37% in 1985 to 36% in 2005, the level of suitable for courses was the most important reason for the students to select a major. Similarly, the attention of pupils which was paid on the resources and sport facilities was ~~all~~ both in a decline ~~tendency~~ from 21% and 18% in 1985 to 16% and 5% in 2005. What should be mentioned is that the rank of facilities for sport decreased from third to the last which ~~is the maximum~~ experienced the biggest decline. 

Compared with these three factors, the distance to home and the quality of teaching in 2005,~~as~~ having = with 20% and 15% , were more important for stduents than what they were in 1985 which were 7% and 13%. ~~Clearly, the teaching is the factor which increased with a maximum value.~~ Clearly, the distance to home stood out as the percentage of students choosing it rose most dramatically.
