There was a noticable percent difference for travel to work, 2% in 1985 as opposed to 4 times of it (8%).

~~Time spending on going out, the third percent for an adult spend in a day in 1958 (19%), reduced to 6% (nearly one third of what it was) same as it in other activities.~~


Although being the lowest of only 2% in 1958 for travel to work, the percentage of time spent on it by working adults quadrupled to 8% by 2008. 
 
 
The time spending on going out went down from 19% in 1958 to the minimal value of 6%, equaling with that of others, the only one activity using the same amount of time in both years.

As a summary, compared with 50 years ago,emloyees spent more time on the activities for work but less time was spent on the entertainment in 2008.


blablabla...
