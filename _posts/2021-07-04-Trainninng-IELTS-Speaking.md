I think it should be the desk which is maded by the wood and extremly old in the study room. As my mom said, when she was a middle school student, the desk was uesed for her study. 

It is a really typical wood desk, rectangular table top with four cuboid legs. I heared from my mom, this desk was bought at about forty years ago. It is still stable. It is really heavy and really hard to move, howeverï¼Œwhen we make a move for our flat we will take it to a new area. How to say, it is a part of my family. 
There are so many signs of aging on it. Mine, my mom's, some words some scars. We always said the time is like a knife. So I think, the scars on the desk, is the shape of time.
All in all, thanks for that desk, countless memeries will emerge from the watching on it. It was the desk when when my mom worked hard for her future. It is the desk when I am working hard for my furture  and it will, I hope, it will be the desk for my child when he or she will work her for his or her future.
