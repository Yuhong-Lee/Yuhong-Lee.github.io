Library, special for the poublic library, is a important area for the citizens to improve themselves. In a scilence and quiet area, the efficiency for self study can be impoved to a really high level. This kind of atmosphere can never be offered by the computers.

For the value of architecture, library is a special building which can reflect a culture for an area. For example, the library in the university of Liverpool ,a college in UK,is a really old libray with red wall and a typical England design which reflect the aesthetic of English culture. And the library in the university of SuZhou in China is a typical estern building with some many kinds of Chinese elements such as Chinese garden in there which can be thought as a model for the style of JiangSu. These special meanings for the libries are irreplaceble by the computers.

For the influence of family, as a famous words said "parents are the first teacher for Children", the behaviors of parents can diectly influence them for children. This is the reason why children whose father or mother is an artist would more like to select the job for arts in future than the children in normal family. Another important factor of family is the atmosphere, there are so many papers stated that the children who grew in a relax atmosphere family are much more out-going than them from a strict atmosphere family. The children can be thought as the honest feedbacks of their family **where parents can teacher them life skills, pass down family traditions and disciplines and cultivate them good hadbits.**

The effects of outside can also not be ignored. On the way of growth for children, friends are the important role in it especially for the children whose parents are too busy to play with them. Friends can affect him or her not only in action but also in mind. For example, if a child whose friends are all good at study, this good learning atomesphere from friends would probably produce the same frequency for those who have the same aim with them. However, if all the friends are in a negative attitude for the future, it can be really eaily for this child going to be same as them. What is more, it is the schools that play an essential role in cultivating children's intelligence as well as enabling them to learn so many important skills for their future such as the self-study, cooperation, comminciation and so on which can be hard learnt from their parents.
