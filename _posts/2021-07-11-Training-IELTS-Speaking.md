I think it should be a string of the olivary seeds. You know in china we called it as "Wen Wan". Wen is means the artical and the "wan" can be thought as joys. Or can be thuoght as a kind of ornaments special for some seeds or stone. I got this about three years ago, I was in Beijing and vist a old and famous market special for the collections. A really huge market with many kinds of street market. 
I really like it, during the time you take it, the color on it will be changed with time. I like this kind of things, can be thought as a sign of the time. I also like its color, when I bought it, it is in a kind of color of light yellow and with the time going by, the color will be changed as a kind of red and because of the friction your hand and going to be like a special jewelry which is created by yourself. I really like this feeling. My friend who can be thought as a master in this, told me that "as a player for 'WenWan' our hands are the really smoothy friction for it ". To be hnoest, I was really shocked by this words. Not only the ornaments or the seeds but also for us, we are in friction of life. We are the seeds, we are on the way to be a jewelry.

I think it should be the time at Halloween about six years old when I was a student in the university of Liverpool.
I think it should be the clothes what my roomate weared in six years old in the Halloween when I was a student in the university of Liverpool.

You know, the Halloween is the day which is really crazy I think. I never experienced the time like that day. All the city is going to be city. I and my roomates prepared well for that day and try to enjoy the first Halloween of our life. After the elaborately make up we descided to go to a famous club and have a drink or emmm we expected to booze for daylight. But so many people, certainly it is a kind of culture maybe, with the same idea as us. A extrem long line on our way to that club. You know, the most boring thing is not something you know it is boring but something you thought it would be interesting but not meet the expection of yours. We through the expectation to the hopeless. Too bored to wait, you know most of people will predrunk before they go to club. So bored,noisy. What is more upset, when we are nearly to the head of the line, they told us , the club is fulled. What boring experimence.

You know, the Halloween is the day which is really crazy I think. I never experienced the time like that day. All the city is going to be city. We prepared well for that day and try to enjoy the first Halloween of our life. After the elaborately make up. I am so suprised for my frient who used to be a girl who really gentle, quiet or can be thought as shy i think. Her make-up is really crazy, With blood on her mouse, her face. And the cloth is really different or unusual, all in all, maybe in that day unusual is usual. A black one- piece dress with so many kinds of strange patterns,such hands,human skeleton or some totems I think. A black hat with some lighter on it. You know, shiny all the time. Believe me, no one would dress like this except that day. But how to say, I thought a special beauty for her. And feel shocked for this. To be honest, it is unusual cloth , but with a kind of unusual beauty special for that day.
