I think it should be a group project when I was a student in the University of Melboure.
You know, as a master special for the study field of computer. we always need to finish the group assignment. Therefore, I and two of my friends formed a group.
One of my friend was really good at programing lets name he as Alex, but another one did not lets name he has Bob. Therefore, one can finish the target as soon as possible but another one not. As a bug happenned, you know , programer always need to face the bugs. Under the pressure of the due, an argument between them happenned. I felt so nervous but I tried to calm down as soon as possible as what said as that "All things are difficult before they are easy", So i try to solve this argument. Therefore, for Alex, I encourged him to do more work as said "You know we are nearly the deadline, and as we all know Bob is good at writting of report but not programming. We can let him do more job on that." And for Bob I give hime an advice "We all know you had tried your best, but you know bug is bug and we do not have enough time to debug it. You can prepare for the report about what we had done now. And Alex and me will try to finish the program".
You know an argument happenned, we need to find the key point of why it going to be like this. For us is the deadline, they all agreed with me and we worked perfectly. They also backed to friends
