   It is in Paris, the capital of Frence. It happened on the trip of my holiday when i was a student in the University of Liverpool. For some reason, I didn't travel with my friends. We all have our own plan for the visit of Paris on that day. And I plan to walk to the Champs Elysées. Unfortunately, I forgot to check the battery of my mobile phone that was the beginning of series of things later. It was the time When I followed the Google map on my way to with the walking-navigation. and suddenly heard the alarm of the dead of my phone's battery. To be honest, I didn't respond that at first and kept walking. However, when I came to a intersection , when there is no guidance, when I took that black screen iphone, emmm, I remember it is iphone 6. I realised that something is wrong. When I tried to speak English to passers-by to find my route but got a reply in French, I was really desperate  or hopeless. I tried my best to calm down And just try to go straight on my way. Believe it not, it is not bad when you lost youself in a overseas city, you can feel that every thing is different, everything is new, everything can suprise. Luckily I found the ninth university which also be named as the University parise Dauphine. I remember there for its special name and I remember how to from there to the triumphal arch. You know when you find the triumphal arch you can directly to the Champs Elysées. I finally get a charger and a dinner at the champs Elysees.
