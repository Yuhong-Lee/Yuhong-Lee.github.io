1. Describe a law on environmental protection
   1. what it is 
   2. how you first learn about it 
   3. who benefits 
   4. what is your feel

I think it should be the environmenyt protection law for the factory or some industry company.
The first time learn about that is from a discussion about the enviroment with father, who is an engineer for metallurgy.
As he introduced, the emissions from the plants should be purified to suit the stipulations on that law. And the before they go into production, the purification equipment should should be equiped and pass the test of goverment. They will be charged fot a hveay penalty and the boss and other related ones with this accident will be judged if they emit the pollution things to air , river or anyth
When I heard about this, I thought all the citizens, environment and maybe all the human in world can be benefited from this. You know as what is a famours word said that "protecting the environment, is the treasure life." 
In my opinion, protect the environemnt is the protection for ourselves.Such as ancient Babylon which culture disappared for the igorance of the protection of Environment
