The area where I really like to traveled is the National Galley of Victority. A gally locaked in the south melbourne and near to the Flinders street train station. If I'm free such as the weekends i will visit there. Because it is really quiet area, by the way, the outside is really noisy and crowded because it is a really famous gallery or a tourist attraction. It is a special building with a half-round door and a special water curtain with glass used to divide the line of travelers, the centre of it always be used to exhibit the huge artwork, such as the huge sculpture or Sculpture group, the Large painting or some thing special. It is total eight area for visisting include the rest area and art area in the four flows. 
I really like there, i can relax there. Temporarily let go of the troubles of learning. It is a really quite and peaceful area with a special atmosphere. And I can see the works of many masters of art. Such as Cai guo-qiang,by the way, poster of hime is still on the wall of it in google map. He is the chief of fire work designer for Olympics.  Such as Yayoi Kusama who can be thought as one of the most famous artiest in Janpan.

For Cai guo-qiang, the artist who like to use the explosion, the firework to create the unique art work. The black bird filled sky with a special beauty. In the gallery. And the art works with chinese chapater. When I heard the news he will hold an art exhibition. I feel so excited and cannot my self to book the exhibition. And he did not let me down. The art work with well-planed, as you know it is really hard to concal the explision. 

For the large area with a well-ventilated, the mesume can let me feel really comfortable.
