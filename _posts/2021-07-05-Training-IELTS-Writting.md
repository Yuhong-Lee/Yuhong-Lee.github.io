The maps given a comparison for a countryside park which were obviously changed from what it was in 10 years ago. 

Obviously, the entrance of this park did not change anymore which is still located in the north-western corner which is same as ten years ago despite a cycle path is set up. Cross the gap between car park which is extended more than twice larger than before and the tennis counts whose number is as double as what it was, in the centre of this park, there located a less size football pitch. And keep in the same direction, at the south-eastern part, pond and woods had been replaced as Boating lake and cafe.
Interestingly, if travellers want to eat something in outside, they can go to a picnic area which is currently erected on the blank area at the south-western corner. And, if they want to go to WC, a toilet is built on the east of the football pitch. 
For the north-east of this part, compared with ten years old, the area for children playing is enlarged and divided into two areas, children play area and children soft play area. 

Even several differences, some facilities were built, some were removed and some were updated, the entrance will remain consistent.
