Specially, in Sydney, Melbourne and Hoart, the precents of it can be more than 60%. On the contrary, compared with other two methods, Australian do not like to buy the fresh coffee. In particular, less than 35% respondent bought the fresh coffee in Brisbane and Adelaide and even in Melbourne and Sydney where buying fresh coffee is more welcome than it in other three cities, only near 44% people bought the fresh coffee.

Interestingly, in Adelaide, the instant coffee is the best choice(50%) for the people who expect to drunk coffee or tea in last 4 weeks. It is noticeable that it is second rank in other four cities.
